## The Platform
--
The chosen platform to our deliverable will be on PC (Keyboard + Mouse or Controller Support). We chose this platform due to our team’s familiarity developing for the PC console. Furthermore, we strongly believe that the project synthesizes uniquely with our target platform due to the separation of our game mechanics between the keyboard and mouse, which integrate to create a harmonious experience.

## The Machinery
•	What are the mechanics, rules and economies you’re basing your project around? What are the larger meta-structures?
•	Comprehensively detail these core mechanics and features of your game individually (separate the Power Pellets, Ghosts and Cherries!), and cross link them to one another. 
•	Present as a clearly and consistently formatted combination of images, diagrams and text.
•	Sometimes a diagram or flowchart can more quickly communicate mechanical ideas than words alone. Consider also using Finite State Machines (FSMs) in these cases.
•	Link these pages to and from relevant Trello cards in your team's board, so that team members working on tasks can refer easily to the documentation.
	


## Brand Identity & Target Audience
•	What makes your product unique in terms of its branding?
•	What kinds of concepts and emotions do you aim to associate with the brand?
•	In this instance the brand is simultaneously the game, the developer and the publisher, who all may convey very particular characteristics that you wish to leverage.
•	Present an overview of your target demographic
•	Substantiate your claim with reference to government, industry or academically-sourced statistics.

## The Schedule
•	Detailed schedule broken down into tasks, milestones, deliverables and dependencies across the remaining weeks of Semester
The wiki may also include pages for additional or archival project reference / details, such as:
•	Narrative: synopsis / back-story / characters / settings
•	Paper design of game-play mechanics
•	Draft level design
•	Functional specification of key features
•	Concept art and visual reference
